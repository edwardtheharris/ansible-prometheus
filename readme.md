## Usage

If you're running on the author's network, usage is as simple
as running the command below.

```{code-block} shell
ansible-playbook site.yml
```

If not, you should be familiar enough with the 
[Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/)
to sort out how to update this to run on your network.


Remember, RTFM! Just not this one.
